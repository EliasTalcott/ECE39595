As a hint:
The object display grid should hold all of the objects, and is used to keep track of where they are.  When an object changes at a display grid point, you should update what is displaying on the asciiPanel.
Rooms should contain all of the creatures and items that are in the room in the .xml file, and when you display a room you should display these items.  The creatures should contain any items that are declared inside of them in the .xml file. 
Reading day: Wednesday Nov. 4 is a reading day.  We will not have any homework, etc., due next week.  I'll get another assignment out sometime this week or next due the following week.
